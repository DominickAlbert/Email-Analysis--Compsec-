# Phishing Email Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a **Phishing Email Detection System** using machine learning techniques, including **Federated Learning** and **Explainable AI (XAI)**. The system analyzes email metadata (e.g., sender, receiver, date, subject, body, URLs) to classify emails as legitimate or phishing. It is designed to protect users from malicious emails while preserving privacy through federated learning.

The project integrates with the **Gmail API** to notify users about high-risk emails in real-time, ensuring timely alerts for potential threats.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset?select=CEAS_08.csv). It contains labeled emails with features such as sender, receiver, subject, body, and URLs, making it suitable for training and evaluating phishing detection models.
